**IMPORTANT: TO  COLLABORATORS AFTER YOU CLONED THE REPO, HERE ARE A FEW STEPS TO DO BEFORE YOU BEGIN MAKING YOUR OWN BRANCH":

1. Type "git branch" to check what branch you are in. (YOU SHOULD BE IN  "MAIN" BRANCH). BUT IF NOT:
    1A. Do "git checkout main" to make sure you're on main branch.
2. Then "git pull" to make sure any changes that were merged from any collaborators on the main branch are up to date.
3. After the two steps above are completed, you are free to make your own branch with "git branch whateverNameGoesHere =)"
  3a. After making a git branch, use "git checkout whateverNameGoesHere =)" to check into your branch.
  


** ALSO, I already created a commit back up log for us if any thing goes wrong, we can revert changes, but lets have some fun with this project =).**
